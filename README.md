# JavaFundraiserDatabase
School Assignment - Simple Netbeans program that is a fundraiser database.  
Has ID#, Title, First/Last Name, Dollar Amount, Charity name, and date.  It was a little better, asthetics-wise, and the program
asks the user whether they saved their work prior to exiting the program.
